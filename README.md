## What this project is about
This project is about creating the illusion of holograms. For this we use a truncated pyramid with four sides made from a nearly transparent material (like plastic CD covers) and a device with a display (e.g. smartphone or laptop). This software displays an image four times, each image rotated by 90 degrees more than the one before it. You than have to place the truncated pyramid in the center of those images and et voil√†, you will see (the illusion of) a hologram from four point of views.

## How this project works
The principal this project is based on is the [*Pepper's Ghost effect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost). In short, this is a technique with which you create the illusion of a hologram with just an image source (the display of your device) and a nearly transparent flat surface tilted above it. The light of the image will then reflect on the surface. If a person looks directly on the surface, he will see the background through it and the image shown on the display, but floating in the air. If you, for example, show a person standing in front of a black background on your device, the user will only see the person. This is, because black surfaces emit nearly no light, leading to no reflection on the reflectional surface.

## What will be added to this project in the future
- add support for gif-files
- (the ability to change the size of the display area)
- add support for more sides to show the image &rarr; leading to more viewing angles
